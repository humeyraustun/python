Problem :

Task : Estimating the risk of death from coronavirus.

Consider the following questions in terms of True/False regarding anyone else.

Are you a cigarette addict older than 75 years old? Variable → age

Do you have a severe chronic disease? Variable → chronic

Is your immune system too weak? Variable → immune

Set a logical algorithm using boolean logic operators (and/or) and the given variables in order to give us True (there is a risk of death) or 
False (there is not a risk of death) as a result.

age= input( "Are you a cigarette addict older than 75 years old?:")

chronic= input ( "Do you have a severe chronic disease? :")

immune= input ("Is your immune system too weak?:")

age_= (age=="True")

chronic_ =(chronic== "True")

immune_ = (immune== "True")

risk = (age_ or chronic_ or immune_)and  "risky life" or "your are healthy"  

print (risk)
