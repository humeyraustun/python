Task : Let's say; you left a message in the past that prints a password you need. To see the password you wrote, you need to enter your name and the program should recognize you. Write a program that

1- Takes the first name from the user and compares it to yours,

2- Then if the name the user entered is the same as yours, print out such as : "Hello, Joseph! The password is : W@12",

3- If the name the user entered is not the same as yours, print out such as : "Hello, Amina! See you later."

name= str(input("what is your name:").lower().strip())
if name =="joseph":
    print ("Hello {} your password is W@12".format(name))
else:
    print ("Hello, {} see you later.".format (name))
    
print (name)
